MTC Intelligent Parking Project
Simulator ver 1.0
Initiator: Qi Luo
Date: December 2015
 
Description: 
-This is a simulator for connected intelligent vehicle parking project. Vehicles are entering the parking structure as a queue, searching for parking spaces, staying for a random period and left. Only vehicles equipped with sensors provide useful information, so we also need to simulate their path decision process. 
-The objective is to answering these questions: what percentage of "probe cars" is needed to deliver sufficient information? Will frequently activate parked vehicles improve the overall performance? What incentives will affect people's patterns and the system's efficiency?	 

Policy:
-PUSH to git only after you have finished debugging. Don't leave unfinished work to other team members.
-COMMENT your code clearly and concisely.
-COMMUNICATE when you meet some problems in your work or when you are reading other's code.
-MODULE scripts for specific functions.
